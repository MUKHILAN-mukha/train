Code Report: Train Ticket Booking System

1.Introduction:
This report evaluates a C program designed to facilitate train ticket booking.
The system allows users to select a train, compartment class, and seat, input 
passenger details, and generates a ticket with PNR number and fare calculation.

2.Code Structure:
*The code consists of several sections:
*Definitions of necessary libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, etc.).
*Structs for storing train and passenger details.
*Functions for displaying available trains, seats, loading animation, and generating PNR.
*The `main()` function orchestrates the entire ticket booking process.

3.Key Features:
*Modular Design: The code is divided into functions, each responsible for a specific task,
 promoting code readability and maintainability.
*Dynamic Input: Users can input details such as train selection, compartment class, and 
 seat number interactively through the terminal.
*Visual Presentation: The use of ANSI escape codes (`\033[0m`, `\033[0;31m`, etc.) enhances
 the visual appeal of the output, providing color-coded information to users.
*Loading Animation: During ticket processing, a loading animation is displayed, adding a 
 user-friendly feature to the system.

4.Functionality:
*Display Available Trains: The `displayTrains()` function presents a tabular view of available
 trains, including details such as train number, departure time, and platform number.
*Select Compartment and Seat: Users can choose the compartment class (first class, sleeper 
 class, or general compartment) and seat number from the available options.
*Input Passenger Details: The system prompts users to enter passenger details like name, 
 age, and gender for each ticket.
*Generate Ticket: After inputting all necessary information, the system generates a ticket 
 with a unique PNR number and displays passenger details along with fare calculation.

5.Conclusion:
 The provided C program offers a functional train ticket booking system with interactive 
 features and visual enhancements. 
 With some refinements in user interface, it can provide a seamless experience for users booking 
 train tickets through the terminal.
